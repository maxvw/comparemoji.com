# Comparemoji.com
Compare emojis on different platforms on [comparemoji.com](https://comparemoji.com)

## Why?
This project exists mostly as an excuse for me to play with [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view). But since every platform has it's own emojis I thought it would be nice to easily compare between them, you can do this per-emoji on a site like [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org), which actually provides a lot of useful information and supports more platforms.

## Data sources
The current dataset (`priv/emojis.json`) is generated on **July 12th, 2020** from:
- https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html
- https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-modifiers.html
